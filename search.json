    "section": "",
    "text": "Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)\nIn this blog post I have tried explaining and implementing local sensitive hashing with zero loops i.e. only tensor operations. Let’s dive in.\nLocal sensitive hashing (LSH) is a technique used in approximate nearest neighbor search and similarity-based retrieval tasks. LSH helps in efficiently finding similar items or reducing the search space for similarity queries.\nLSH works by hashing similar items into the same or nearby hash buckets with a high probability. It operates on the principle that if two items are similar, they are likely to collide (hash to the same bucket) under a certain hash function.\nLSH is “local sensitive” because it ensures that nearby items have a higher probability of being hashed into the same bucket, while items that are far apart have a lower probability of colliding. This property allows for efficient pruning of the search space, as we can focus the search on the items within the same hash buckets.\nThere are different types of LSH algorithms designed for various data types and similarity measures. Some common examples include MinHash for document similarity, SimHash for binary data, and L2-LSH for Euclidean distance-based similarity.\nLSH is particularly useful in scenarios where traditional exact search methods become impractical due to high-dimensional data or large dataset sizes. It allows for approximate similarity search with reduced computational complexity, making it a valuable tool in various applications like recommendation systems, image retrieval, and DNA sequence matching.\n\n#!pip install fastcore\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport torch\nfrom fastcore.all import patch\n\n\ntorch.manual_seed(42)\ntorch.set_printoptions(precision=3, linewidth=140, sci_mode=False)\n\nI defined the class FastLSH below which takes the following arguments - dimensions: This is the number of features in the dataset. The higher the number of dimensions, the more complex the LSH algorithm will be. - hash_length: This is the length of the hash value. The longer the hash value, the more accurate the LSH algorithm will be. However, a longer hash value will also take longer to compute. - number_hash_tables: This is the number of hash tables that are used by the LSH algorithm. The more hash tables, the more likely it is that two similar items will be hashed to the same table. However, a larger number of hash tables will also take longer to search. - hash_table: This is a data structure that stores the hash values of the items in the dataset. The hash table is used to quickly find items that have similar hash values.\n\nclass FastLSH:\n    def __init__(self, dim, nht, hl):\n        self.dimensions = dim # dimensions of the data\n        self.num_hash_tables = nht # number of hash tables\n        self.hash_length = hl # hash length\n        self.hash_table = torch.randn(self.num_hash_tables, self.hash_length, self.dimensions) # the hashtable\n\n\nfastlsh = FastLSH(dim=2, nht=5, hl=10)\n\n\nfastlsh.hash_table.shape\n\ntorch.Size([5, 10, 2])\n\n\n\ndata = torch.randn(150_000, 2) # data\nquery = data[0][None] # query, adding a unit axis at the start\ndata.shape, query.shape\n\n(torch.Size([150000, 2]), torch.Size([1, 2]))\n\n\nThe purpose of the following hashing code is to apply hash functions to each data point in the input tensor. It performs a cosine similarity between the query and the hashtable, generating hash codes for every data point in the query. The resulting tensor contains these hash codes.\nThe patch decorator patches the function to the LSH class. More about patch here\n\n@patch\ndef hashing(self:FastLSH, query): \n    return (((query[:, None, None]) * self.hash_table).sum(-1) &gt;= 0).long()\n\nLet’s utilize the hashing function mentioned above to hash both the query and data points.\n\ndata_hash = fastlsh.hashing(data)\ndata_hash.shape\n\ntorch.Size([150000, 5, 10])\n\n\nBased on the obtained data_hash.shape from the above, we can observe that each of the 150_000 data points has been hashed using 5 hash functions, resulting in hash codes of length 10 for each data point.\n\nquery_hash = fastlsh.hashing(query)\nquery_hash.shape\n\ntorch.Size([1, 5, 10])\n\n\nNow, let’s proceed to obtain the indexes of data where the hash code of each data point matches the hash code of the query point.\nTo determine if the hash codes are the same, we can begin by calculating the dot product along the last axis and dividing it by the sum of the corresponding axis in the data. If the resulting values are equal to 1, it indicates that the hash codes are the same. Otherwise, if the values differ from 1, it implies that the hash codes are not the same.\n\n(query_hash * data_hash).sum(-1)\n\ntensor([[4, 5, 2, 6, 5],\n        [1, 3, 2, 2, 3],\n        [4, 3, 0, 4, 3],\n        ...,\n        [2, 3, 2, 5, 4],\n        [1, 3, 2, 3, 3],\n        [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]])\n\n\n\ndata_hash.sum(-1)\n\ntensor([[ 4,  5,  2,  6,  5],\n        [ 4,  8,  9,  6,  6],\n        [ 6,  3,  0,  4,  5],\n        ...,\n        [ 5,  6,  4,  8,  4],\n        [ 4,  7,  7,  7,  6],\n        [ 4,  6, 10,  6,  4]])\n\n\n\n(query_hash * data_hash).shape\n\ntorch.Size([150000, 5, 10])\n\n\n\n(query_hash * data_hash).sum(-1) / data_hash.sum(-1) \n\ntensor([[1.000, 1.000, 1.000, 1.000, 1.000],\n        [0.250, 0.375, 0.222, 0.333, 0.500],\n        [0.667, 1.000,   nan, 1.000, 0.600],\n        ...,\n        [0.400, 0.500, 0.500, 0.625, 1.000],\n        [0.250, 0.429, 0.286, 0.429, 0.500],\n        [0.000, 0.167, 0.200, 0.333, 0.250]])\n\n\n\nresult = ( (query_hash * data_hash).sum(-1) / data_hash.sum(-1) ) == 1\nresult\n\ntensor([[ True,  True,  True,  True,  True],\n        [False, False, False, False, False],\n        [False,  True, False,  True, False],\n        ...,\n        [False, False, False, False,  True],\n        [False, False, False, False, False],\n        [False, False, False, False, False]])\n\n\nWe can obtain the indices where the values are True using the following code.\n\nresult_indices = torch.nonzero(torch.any(result, dim=1)).flatten()\nresult_indices.shape\n\ntorch.Size([50337])\n\n\n\ndata[result_indices].shape\n\ntorch.Size([50337, 2])\n\n\nNow that we have obtained the indices, let’s proceed to compute the Euclidean distance (L2 norm).\nTo compute the Euclidean distance, we don’t need to calculate the distance from every one of the 150_000 points. Instead, we only need to compute the distance from the points where the hash codes are the same, as we have already determined from the indices obtained.\n\n((query - data[result_indices])**2).sum(-1).sqrt().shape\n\ntorch.Size([50337])\n\n\nWe can consolidate all of the aforementioned operations into a single function by defining the following function\n\n@patch\ndef query_neigbours(self:FastLSH, query, data, data_hash, neighbours=10):\n    query_hash = self.hashing(query)\n    result = ( (query_hash * data_hash).sum(-1) / data_hash.sum(-1) ) == 1\n    result_indices = torch.nonzero(torch.any(result, dim=1)).flatten()\n    \n    dist = ((query - data[result_indices]) ** 2).sum(-1).sqrt()\n    sorted_dist, idx = torch.sort(dist)\n    \n    \n    return sorted_dist[:neighbours], result_indices[idx[:neighbours]]\n\n\nquery = data[0][None]; query.shape\n\ntorch.Size([1, 2])\n\n\n\ndata_hash = fastlsh.hashing(data)\nfastlsh.query_neigbours(query, data, data_hash, 10)\n\n(tensor([0.000, 0.004, 0.004, 0.005, 0.007, 0.007, 0.009, 0.009, 0.009, 0.010]),\n tensor([     0,  16866,  13708,  29511,  37183,  31814,   9378, 122251, 131806,   4483]))\n\n\n\n%timeit -n 5 _=fastlsh.query_neigbours(query, data, data_hash, 10)\n\n11.9 ms ± 643 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 5 loops each)\n\n\n\nGPU\nI’m currently unable to determine how to pass batches of query points for computing the hash and obtaining the distances.

    "section": "",
    "text": "I just finished Part 1 of Hugging Face NLP course and wanted to put my new skills to the test. I stumbled upon a Hugging Face competition called Movie Genre Prediction, where the challenge is to guess the movie genre based on the synopsis and title. In this blog post, I’ll share my journey and findings. Let’s dive in!\nLets install the following packages by uncommenting the following code if not installed already\n\n# !pip install datasets\n# !pip install transformers -U\n# !pip install huggingface_hub\n# !pip install rich\n# !pip install accelerate -U\n# !pip install evaluate\n\nFollowing are the steps to create hugging face credentials token which be needed when using notebook_login below\n\nCreate a Hugging Face account (if you don’t have one): If you don’t already have an account on the Hugging Face website, you’ll need to create one. Visit the Hugging Face website (https://huggingface.co/) and sign up for an account.\nLog in to your Hugging Face account: Use your credentials to log in to your Hugging Face account.\nGenerate an API token: Hugging Face provides API tokens for authentication. To generate an API token, go to your account settings on the Hugging Face website. You can usually find this in your account dashboard or profile settings.\nGenerate the token: Once you’re in your account settings, look for an option related to API tokens or credentials. You should find an option to generate a new token. Click on it, and the system will generate a unique API token for you.\nCopy the API token: Once the token is generated, you’ll typically see it displayed on the screen. It might be a long string of characters. Copy this token to your clipboard.\nStore the token securely: API tokens are sensitive credentials, so it’s essential to store them securely. You should never share your API token publicly or expose it in your code repositories.\n\nNow, you have your Hugging Face API token, which you can use for authentication when making requests to the Hugging Face API or accessing resources on the Hugging Face Model Hub.\n\nfrom huggingface_hub import notebook_login\n\nnotebook_login()\n\n\n\n\nLets import the following pacakges\n\nfrom transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification\nfrom datasets import load_dataset, Dataset\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport evaluate\nimport numpy as np\nfrom rich import print\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\n\nWe will be using the datadrivenscience/movie-genre-prediction competition dataset for model training. You can read more about the competition here and the dataset here.\n\ndataset = load_dataset(\"datadrivenscience/movie-genre-prediction\"); dataset\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'movie_name', 'synopsis', 'genre'],\n        num_rows: 54000\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'movie_name', 'synopsis', 'genre'],\n        num_rows: 36000\n    })\n})\n\n\nThe dataset has train and test splits with following features - id - movie name - synopsis - genre\n\nprint(dataset['train'][:3])\n\n{\n    'id': [44978, 50185, 34131],\n    'movie_name': ['Super Me', 'Entity Project', 'Behavioral Family Therapy for Serious Psychiatric Disorders'],\n    'synopsis': [\n        'A young scriptwriter starts bringing valuable objects back from his short nightmares of being chased by a \ndemon. Selling them makes him rich.',\n        'A director and her friends renting a haunted house to capture paranormal events in order to prove it and \nbecome popular.',\n        'This is an educational video for families and family therapists that describes the Behavioral Family \nTherapy approach to dealing with serious psychiatric illnesses.'\n    ],\n    'genre': ['fantasy', 'horror', 'family']\n}\n\n\n\nAbove we have sliced and printed 3 rows of training dataset\n\nlabels = set(dataset['train']['genre'])\nnum_labels = len(labels)\nlabels\n\n{'action',\n 'adventure',\n 'crime',\n 'family',\n 'fantasy',\n 'horror',\n 'mystery',\n 'romance',\n 'scifi',\n 'thriller'}\n\n\nThere are 10 genres, - action - adventure - crime - family - fantasy - horror - mystery - romance - scifi - thriller\n\nlabels_count = Counter(dataset['train']['genre']); print(labels_count)\n\nCounter({\n    'fantasy': 5400,\n    'horror': 5400,\n    'family': 5400,\n    'scifi': 5400,\n    'action': 5400,\n    'crime': 5400,\n    'adventure': 5400,\n    'mystery': 5400,\n    'romance': 5400,\n    'thriller': 5400\n})\n\n\n\nLooks like the labels are evenly sampled, everyone has count of 5400. Thats good.\n\ndataset = dataset.rename_column('genre', 'labels')\n\n\ndataset = dataset.class_encode_column(\"labels\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above steps we rename the column genre to labels to mark the genre as target variable\nThen we convert the labels to ClassLabel type\n\ndataset['train'].features['labels']\n\nClassLabel(names=['action', 'adventure', 'crime', 'family', 'fantasy', 'horror', 'mystery', 'romance', 'scifi', 'thriller'], id=None)\n\n\nConverting labels to the ClassLabel type in the Hugging Face library helps with:\n\nConsistency: It makes your labels work smoothly with the library’s tools and models.\nNumber Conversion: It turns text labels into numbers, which some models need.\nEasy Mapping: It simplifies translating between text labels and numbers.\n\n\n\n\nI could not find a bettery way to remove duplicates than converting to pandas, removing duplicates and converting back to hugging face dataset.\n\ntrain_df = pd.DataFrame(dataset['train']) # converting to pandas\n\n\ntrain_df = train_df.drop_duplicates(['movie_name', 'synopsis']) # Removes duplicates based on `movie_name` and `synopsis` attributes\n\n\nds = Dataset.from_pandas(train_df) # converting back to dataset\n\n\nds.features['labels']\n\nValue(dtype='int64', id=None)\n\n\nWhen converting a dataset from pandas, it creates the label type as Value. However, we will need to subsequently convert it to ClassLabel.\n\nds = ds.class_encode_column(\"labels\"); ds # \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset({\n    features: ['id', 'movie_name', 'synopsis', 'labels', '__index_level_0__'],\n    num_rows: 46344\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheckpoint = \"bert-base-uncased\"\n\nA checkpoint is a saved model state, including its architecture and trained weights, which can be used for various NLP tasks and fine-tuning.\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\ntokenizer('Movie Genre Predictions with Hugging Face Transformers')\n\n{'input_ids': [101, 3185, 6907, 20932, 2007, 17662, 2227, 19081, 102], 'token_type_ids': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\nAbove we load the tokenizer and use it on a sentence. Loading a checkpoint of a tokenizer associated with a pretrained language model is necessary to maintain consistency in the tokenization process. This ensures that your input text is processed in a way that aligns with the model’s pre-existing knowledge and allows you to use the pretrained model effectively\nWhat is attention_mask? &gt; Sometimes, we want to tell the computer which parts of the sentence are important and which are not. The attention mask is like a spotlight. It’s a list of 1s and 0s, where 1 means “pay attention” and 0 means “ignore.” For our sentence, it could be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] because we want the computer to pay attention to all tokens.\nWhat is token_type_ids? &gt; If you have multiple sentences, you’d want the computer to know which sentence each token belongs to. Token Type IDs help with that. For one sentence, it’s all 0s. If you had two sentences, the first sentence would have 0s, and the second sentence would have 1s.\nLet’s break down the process of creating input_ids below into following steps:\n\n\nImagine you have a sentence, “Hugging Face is awesome!” To help a computer understand it, you first split it into smaller parts, like words: [“Hugging”, “Face”, “is”, “awesome”, “!”]. These smaller parts are called tokens.\nWe can tokenize the synopsis of the first row of training set\n\ndataset['train'][0]['synopsis']\n\n'A young scriptwriter starts bringing valuable objects back from his short nightmares of being chased by a demon. Selling them makes him rich.'\n\n\n\ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(dataset['train'][0]['synopsis']); tokens\n\n['a',\n 'young',\n 'script',\n '##writer',\n 'starts',\n 'bringing',\n 'valuable',\n 'objects',\n 'back',\n 'from',\n 'his',\n 'short',\n 'nightmares',\n 'of',\n 'being',\n 'chased',\n 'by',\n 'a',\n 'demon',\n '.',\n 'selling',\n 'them',\n 'makes',\n 'him',\n 'rich',\n '.']\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers prefer numbers, so we need to convert these tokens into unique numbers. Each token gets a special ID. For example, “Hugging” might be ID 101, “Face” might be ID 102, and so on. The sentence becomes a list of IDs: [101, 102, 103, 104, 105].\n\nids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens); ids\n\n[1037,\n 2402,\n 5896,\n 15994,\n 4627,\n 5026,\n 7070,\n 5200,\n 2067,\n 2013,\n 2010,\n 2460,\n 15446,\n 1997,\n 2108,\n 13303,\n 2011,\n 1037,\n 5698,\n 1012,\n 4855,\n 2068,\n 3084,\n 2032,\n 4138,\n 1012]\n\n\nIn summary, Hugging Face tokenization takes your text, breaks it into tokens (smaller parts), gives each token a unique ID, creates an attention mask to say what’s important, and token type IDs to track different sentences if needed.\n\nds = ds.train_test_split(test_size=0.2, stratify_by_column=\"labels\")\n\nThe above code splits a dataset (ds) into two parts: a training set and a testing set.\n\nThe test_size=0.2 means that 20% of the data will be used for testing, and the remaining 80% for training.\nstratify_by_column=\"labels\" means that the split will ensure both the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of labels (class proportions) as in the original dataset. This is useful for maintaining balance in classification tasks.\n\n\nds\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'movie_name', 'synopsis', 'labels', '__index_level_0__'],\n        num_rows: 37075\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'movie_name', 'synopsis', 'labels', '__index_level_0__'],\n        num_rows: 9269\n    })\n})\n\n\n\ndef tokenize(sample):\n    sample['text'] = list(map(lambda x: ': '.join(x), zip(sample['movie_name'], sample['synopsis']))) \n    return tokenizer(sample['text'], truncation=True)\n\n\ntokenized_ds = ds.map(tokenize, batched=True); tokenized_ds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'movie_name', 'synopsis', 'labels', '__index_level_0__', 'text', 'input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 37075\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'movie_name', 'synopsis', 'labels', '__index_level_0__', 'text', 'input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 9269\n    })\n})\n\n\nThe above code defines a tokenize function that combines text from two columns, movie_name and synopsis, and then tokenizes the combined text using a tokenizer.\n\nsample[text] is created by joining movie_name and synopsis with a colon and space.\nThe tokenizer is applied to the text column with truncation enabled.\n\nAfter defining the function, it’s applied to a dataset (ds) using .map() to tokenize the text in batches, and the result is stored in tokenized_ds.\n\n\n\n\n\ntraining_args = TrainingArguments('movie-genre-predictions', \n                                  evaluation_strategy = 'epoch',\n                                  per_device_train_batch_size = 32,\n                                  per_device_eval_batch_size = 64,\n                                  save_strategy = 'epoch',\n                                  push_to_hub = True, \n                                  learning_rate = 1e-5\n                                 )\n\nThe above code sets up the configuration for training a Hugging Face model, for a movie genre prediction task. Let’s break it down step by step:\n\nTrainingArguments: This is a special object or data structure that holds various settings and options for training a machine learning model.\n'movie-genre-predictions': It’s naming the training process or giving it a unique name. It’s like giving a name to a file so you can easily identify it later.\nevaluation_strategy = 'epoch': This line specifies how often the model’s performance should be evaluated. In this case, it’s set to epoch, which means after every complete pass through the training data. An epoch is like a full round of training.\nper_device_train_batch_size = 32: This indicates how many examples or data points should be processed at once on each processing unit during training. It’s set to 32, so 32 data points will be processed together in parallel.\nper_device_eval_batch_size = 64: Similar to the previous line, but this one specifies the batch size for evaluation (measuring how well the model is doing).

    "text": "checkpoint = \"bert-base-uncased\"\n\nA checkpoint is a saved model state, including its architecture and trained weights, which can be used for various NLP tasks and fine-tuning.\n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)\ntokenizer('Movie Genre Predictions with Hugging Face Transformers')\n\n{'input_ids': [101, 3185, 6907, 20932, 2007, 17662, 2227, 19081, 102], 'token_type_ids': [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 'attention_mask': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}\n\n\nAbove we load the tokenizer and use it on a sentence. Loading a checkpoint of a tokenizer associated with a pretrained language model is necessary to maintain consistency in the tokenization process. This ensures that your input text is processed in a way that aligns with the model’s pre-existing knowledge and allows you to use the pretrained model effectively\nWhat is attention_mask? &gt; Sometimes, we want to tell the computer which parts of the sentence are important and which are not. The attention mask is like a spotlight. It’s a list of 1s and 0s, where 1 means “pay attention” and 0 means “ignore.” For our sentence, it could be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] because we want the computer to pay attention to all tokens.\nWhat is token_type_ids? &gt; If you have multiple sentences, you’d want the computer to know which sentence each token belongs to. Token Type IDs help with that. For one sentence, it’s all 0s. If you had two sentences, the first sentence would have 0s, and the second sentence would have 1s.\nLet’s break down the process of creating input_ids below into following steps:\n\n\nImagine you have a sentence, “Hugging Face is awesome!” To help a computer understand it, you first split it into smaller parts, like words: [“Hugging”, “Face”, “is”, “awesome”, “!”]. These smaller parts are called tokens.\nWe can tokenize the synopsis of the first row of training set\n\ndataset['train'][0]['synopsis']\n\n'A young scriptwriter starts bringing valuable objects back from his short nightmares of being chased by a demon. Selling them makes him rich.'\n\n\n\ntokens = tokenizer.tokenize(dataset['train'][0]['synopsis']); tokens\n\n['a',\n 'young',\n 'script',\n '##writer',\n 'starts',\n 'bringing',\n 'valuable',\n 'objects',\n 'back',\n 'from',\n 'his',\n 'short',\n 'nightmares',\n 'of',\n 'being',\n 'chased',\n 'by',\n 'a',\n 'demon',\n '.',\n 'selling',\n 'them',\n 'makes',\n 'him',\n 'rich',\n '.']\n\n\n\n\n\nComputers prefer numbers, so we need to convert these tokens into unique numbers. Each token gets a special ID. For example, “Hugging” might be ID 101, “Face” might be ID 102, and so on. The sentence becomes a list of IDs: [101, 102, 103, 104, 105].\n\nids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens); ids\n\n[1037,\n 2402,\n 5896,\n 15994,\n 4627,\n 5026,\n 7070,\n 5200,\n 2067,\n 2013,\n 2010,\n 2460,\n 15446,\n 1997,\n 2108,\n 13303,\n 2011,\n 1037,\n 5698,\n 1012,\n 4855,\n 2068,\n 3084,\n 2032,\n 4138,\n 1012]\n\n\nIn summary, Hugging Face tokenization takes your text, breaks it into tokens (smaller parts), gives each token a unique ID, creates an attention mask to say what’s important, and token type IDs to track different sentences if needed.\n\nds = ds.train_test_split(test_size=0.2, stratify_by_column=\"labels\")\n\nThe above code splits a dataset (ds) into two parts: a training set and a testing set.\n\nThe test_size=0.2 means that 20% of the data will be used for testing, and the remaining 80% for training.\nstratify_by_column=\"labels\" means that the split will ensure both the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of labels (class proportions) as in the original dataset. This is useful for maintaining balance in classification tasks.\n\n\nds\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'movie_name', 'synopsis', 'labels', '__index_level_0__'],\n        num_rows: 37075\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'movie_name', 'synopsis', 'labels', '__index_level_0__'],\n        num_rows: 9269\n    })\n})\n\n\n\ndef tokenize(sample):\n    sample['text'] = list(map(lambda x: ': '.join(x), zip(sample['movie_name'], sample['synopsis']))) \n    return tokenizer(sample['text'], truncation=True)\n\n\ntokenized_ds = ds.map(tokenize, batched=True); tokenized_ds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'movie_name', 'synopsis', 'labels', '__index_level_0__', 'text', 'input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 37075\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['id', 'movie_name', 'synopsis', 'labels', '__index_level_0__', 'text', 'input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask'],\n        num_rows: 9269\n    })\n})\n\n\nThe above code defines a tokenize function that combines text from two columns, movie_name and synopsis, and then tokenizes the combined text using a tokenizer.\n\nsample[text] is created by joining movie_name and synopsis with a colon and space.\nThe tokenizer is applied to the text column with truncation enabled.\n\nAfter defining the function, it’s applied to a dataset (ds) using .map() to tokenize the text in batches, and the result is stored in tokenized_ds."
